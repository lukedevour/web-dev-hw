<h1>READ ME<h1 />

<h4> This week we started to work with HTML. I used Firefox as my browser, although I switched back and forth between Firefox and Chrome just to make sure my page worked. A browser functions by reading all elements on the page and displaying them properly for users.

<p> For the Wayback machine, I visited U of M's website from 1999. It was ugly as hell, and seemed to have a fraction of the current website's functionality. I am very glad that I do not have to use that site for anything. <p />

<p> This week was not very difficult, as it was mostly following directions and making sure that all my page elements were in the correct place. I can see how a typo can completely brick someone's code, and it terrifies me. I had one issue where my page would not display properly, but it was fixed with a push to GitHub. I am curious to see what people chose for their poems.
