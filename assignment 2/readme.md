# Technical Report

Version control is the practice of keeping track of changes in documents. This can be done individually or at a group level. This makes it much easier to review changes and see what works and what does not. It is also vital in being able to track bugs in the system. We use it in the class to track our own changes and be able to see what needs to be fixed.

This week I had some issues with figuring out repos. I made the mistake of creating a repo in github desktop before I made one on the github website, and that caused me some major headaches. I definitely need some practice to feel comfortable with having everything where it needs to be. I did not post any responses to the repo this session.
