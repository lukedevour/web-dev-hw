1. Information on the internet travels in bits and packets,
traveling between computers in the most efficient route possible and reassembling
themselves in our web browsers according to domain names and IP addresses.

2. IP addresses are the specific coordinates in which a website resides on the net, and
DNS give us actual web pages so we don't have to memorize long IP numbers.

3. Cookies are small files stored on your computer that hold a small amount of data
specific to that user and website. They carry information from one session to another.

4. Protocol, domain name, and path.
