<h1> Assignment 4 Read Me </h1>
<p><b>A)</b> Divisions are generic containers that divide content.</p>
<p>Classes are used to define equal styles for elements with the same class name</p>
<p>Id specifies a unique Id for an HTML element.</p>
<p>Span is like div, used for grouping, although it functions as an inline element instead of for block elements.</p>

<p><b>B)</b> Alt text or tags are used to indicate what an image is. This is important for web-users who are not able to see images on your page.

<p><b>C)</b> This work cycle was very frustrating for me. I had a very difficult time trying to make everything work together. I was unable to find an audio track for this assignment, and I didn't want to upload my version to the net for fear of copyright infringement, so we will just see how things go.
